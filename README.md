## HangmanGame
#A Game of Hangman (oldschool design) written in Java.

Start the game by pressing the button, on the top left you see lines representing the letters of a word you are supposed to discover. Guess letters by pressing them in the keyboard frame. If the letter is included in the word, it is included at the corresponding positions. If not, then a hangman starts to be build up. If the hangman is complete before the word is fully discovered, you loose the game.
